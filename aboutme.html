          <br>
          <p>My name is Kevon Kee and I was born on September 19th, 2002 in Kingston Jamaica. I'm a quiet person and I tend to keep to myself but I do talk alot around my closest friends and family. Some of my hobbies are watching <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en.html">
              Formula one</a>, cycling, reading and playing video games</p>
          <h3> Likes and dislikes</h3>
          <p>My favorite color is blue and one of my favorite foods is cheeseburgers. I enjoy outdoor activities such as taking hikes and cycling. Some of my favorite holiday activites are ziplining, cliff diving and riding ATVs </p>
          <p>Some things I dislike include the beach, ice cream and people who do not keep their word. The first 2 may seem strange but how much do you really like having sand all over your body? I also have sensitive teeth which makes eating ice
            cream quite unpleasant! </p>

          <h3> Inspirational person</h3>

          <img src="images\Hamilton.png" alt="Lewis Hamilton">
          <h4>"Still I rise"</h4>


          <p>That is a personal motto of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton"> Sir Lewis Hamilton</a> . He is the most successful formula one driver in the history of the sport. He rose to the top despite many challenges and he continues to succeed and go even higher. He
            inspires me because he did not let people telling him he could not achieve something stop him from getting to where he wanted to be</p>
          <h3>Personality Test</h3>
          <p>I agree with some of the results of the personality test as I do see some of those characteristics in myself. I do think it will be accurate to some degree because it is based on a specific set of questions. However there is more to a
            person than that set of questions so online personality tests are not valid to me.</p>
          <p>These are the results of the personality test I did on <a href="http://www.keirsey.com">keirsey.com</a> </p>
