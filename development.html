          <h1>Personal Development</h1>
          <h3>Personal Strengths</h3>
          <p>I would consider one of my personal strengths to be patience. I was not always a patient person. I never used to like waiting in lines or waiting for things to happen and
            I was quick to become upset. Eventually I realized if you cannot control a circumstance you can still control yourself in the situation. In the last 3 to 5 years I have had to develop even more patience as I was learning to drive. Being
            impatient when driving can lead to a potentially life threatening accident so it was very important to develop even more. Another personal strength is my ability to set goals for myself. I can set an objective for myself and I will always
            ensure I do what I set out to do. I have developed this skill in the last 5 years by setting goals for myself when I exercise. No matter how tired I am I continue going until I reach the goal I had set. A third strength is my problem
            solving skills. I can look at a problem and break it down into smaller parts which makes it easier to solve in a step by step manner. I have develped this skill in the last 5 years during my time at University. Particularly in programming
            classes breaking down the problems make the programs much easier to write </p>

          <h3>12 Pillars</h3>
          <p>The book 12 Pillars is about a man named Micheal who was unhappy with his life meeting an old man called Charlie who teaches him 12 things that will help him become more successful. In chapter 4 he is taught about the importance of
            setting goals for himself. Once he sets these goals he must write them down. This will help him begin to form a plan to achieve the goal. I can apply this in my life by setting goals for myself and writing down what I want to achieve.
            Chapter 5 teaches Micheal to make the best use of his time. Each day held many opportunities but only one of those was the best opportunity. Micheal was to ensure he did not regret the way he spent his day as he could not get the day
            back. I can apply this by making sure I make the best use of my time. I really found this chapter inspirational and I will now ensure I make the best possible use of my days as once I spend one I cannot get it back. In chapter 6 Micheal
            has to look at his association and determine if they are helping him move forward. He has to decide if he should increase the time he spends with them, decrease it or if he should stop spending time with them entirely. I can apply this
            by looking at my friends and associates and determine how much time I should really be spending with them. The final chapter of the required reading is about reading. Micheal is taught about the importance of books and continuing to learn
            in life. I already enjoy reading and do so regularly but I can apply this by reading the books on the list Micheal was given to read. I think the 12 Pillars book is full of very good lessons and everyone should read it.</p>
